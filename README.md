Hello and welcome to my page!

The first time I had a contact with website developement was during my studies. We had one-semester "computer studies" course and our task was to build our own website. It was very basic (html only) but still I enjoyed a lot and spent hours researching how to make it more fancy (e.g. with panda gifs ðŸ˜‰). My career went however in a different direction and I am working since many years in media industry. However there was always like a missing piece. It all came together during Corona. I had a lot of spare time and started doing different courses on Udemy.The joy and excitment that I felt back than, came back and I am learning in every spare minute to become a frontend developer.

For some time I was learning alone but two months ago a programmig mentoring, that really fosters my progress. This is what I have learnt so far (tbc of course):

- html

- css

- rwd

- javascript (basics)
