Hello and welcome to my page!

The first time I had a contact with website developement was during my studies. We had one-semester "computer studies" course and our task was to build our own website. It was very basic (html only) but still I enjoyed a lot and spent hours researching how to make it more fancy (e.g. with panda gifs 😉). My career went however in a different direction and I am working since many years in media industry. Though there was always like a missing piece. It all came together during Corona. I had a lot of spare time and started doing different courses on Udemy.The joy and excitement that I felt back than, came back and I am learning in every spare minute to become a frontend developer.

For some time I was learning alone but two months ago I started a programmig mentoring, that really fosters my progress. This is what I have learnt so far (tbc of course):

- html

- css

- rwd

- javascript (basics)

Apart from that, I am sure that the soft-skills that I learnt and developed so far, will be very beneficial as a frontend developer:

👁️ good eye for details -I work a lot with data, dashboards and reportings at my current job

👷 "restorative"- it is one of my top Gallup strength. I can't sleep when something is not working. I just need to repair it!

👀 seeig a bigger picture - that is what I learnt as a team-lead.

👥 team-work -I have always worked in teams (also international) and I really enjoyed it.

👑 understanding client needs - years in client service helped me to understand client needs very well.
