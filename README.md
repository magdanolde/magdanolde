Hello and welcome to my page!

There is this question, often asked during the interviews: "what your co-workers or your boss would say about you". In my case the answer would be "hard-working and very ambitious". And it is true! I am always giving everything and I am really involved in the projects I untertake. ‚ù§

Hence, it is crucial for me to have that a job, that I really enjoy, it fits my strengths and where I see meaning & progress.
It took me some time to find but now, here I am: learning diligently in every spare minute to become a frontend developer.

For some time I was learning alone but two months ago a programmig mentoring, that really fosters my progress. This is what I have learnt so far (tbc of course):

- html

- css

- rwd

- javascript (basics)
